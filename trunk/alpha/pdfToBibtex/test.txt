We report an analytical study of propagation of a straight crack with a stress-induced local phase
transition at the tip. We obtain its contribution to the dynamic fracture energy in explicit form and
demonstrate that it nonmonotonically depends upon the crack tip velocity. We show that its descending
part gives rise to the instability of the steady propagation regime. We obtain the dynamic phase diagram
and indicate those domains where self-oscillating regimes of the crack motion take place.

Unstable growth of cracks in the form of a stick-slip
motion has long been observed in many materials includ-
ing glasses, ceramics, and brittle polymers [1]. In linear
elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) this type of motion was
attributed to a decrease in the resistance of solids to the
crack growth manifested as a negative derivative of the
velocity-dependent fracture energy dÀðvÞ=dv <0. It is
generally accepted that this is related to some nonlinear
processes localized in the vicinity of the crack tip (referred
to as a ‘‘process zone’’) and essentially depends upon the
zone properties. Various mechanisms have been discussed
as candidates responsible for this phenomenon (such as
molecular relaxation, transition from isothermal to adia-
batic regime, crystallization at the crack tip, and micro-
plasticity, [1,2]) though most of these are on a qualitative
level, while efforts to mathematically treat microplasticity-
based models resulted in the conclusion that they are
intrinsically ill-posed [3].
During the last two decades experimental techniques to
study rapid crack propagation have been greatly improved
and applied to a number of materials [4,5]. The similarity
of dynamic fracture behavior of materials with different
microstructures such as brittle polymers, glasses, and some
crystals gave rise to a hope that all of them may be
described by a universal approach. It motivated devising
several phase-ﬁeld models [6] capable of reproducing mi-
crobranching and oscillatory instabilities of straight cracks,
as those reported in [5].
Recently it was assumed [7] that the characteristic
length scale associated with the distance on which crack
proﬁle deviates from LEFMis much larger than the scales
due to any dissipative mechanisms. The results of the
weakly nonlinear model turned out to be in quantitative
agreement with data obtained in brittle gels [8].
One can attribute the nonlinearity accounted for in the
paper [8] to acoustic phonons. In solids with nonprimitive
lattice cells nonlinearity of nonacoustic degrees of freedom
(e.g., related to optical phonons) may take place. If this
happens, it becomes responsible for deviating from pre-
dictions of LEFM. This can result in phase transitions
(PTs) localized in the vicinity of the crack tip referred to
here as ‘‘local phase transitions’’ (LPTs) providing a natu-
ral emergence of the characteristic scale.
The LPT phenomenon attracted attention since late
1970s, being a key mechanism responsible for the effect
of the LPT-related improvement of strength observed in
ZrO
2
-based ceramics and in some steels [9]. Observations
of LPTs at tips of cracks have also been reported for some
other inorganic solids: it has been observed during fracture
of metals (cf. Figure 1 of Ref. [10]) and in ferroelectrics
[11]. Besides LPTwas observed in resins [12] and recently
LPTs following fracture of polymers have been reported
[13]. The LPT effect on the dynamics of cracks has not
been addressed so far.
In this Letter for the ﬁrst time we describe a phys-
ical mechanism responsible for the nonmonotonicity of
À ¼ ÀðvÞ related to LPT at the crack tip, and resulting in
self-oscillations during its propagation. We show that LPT
gives rise to a conﬁgurational viscous friction force resist-
ing the crack motion. It exhibits a descending behavior
