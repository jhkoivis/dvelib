We report an analytical study of propagation of a straight crack with a stress-induced local phase
transition at the tip. We obtain its contribution to the dynamic fracture energy in explicit form and
demonstrate that it nonmonotonically depends upon the crack tip velocity. We show that its descending
part gives rise to the instability of the steady propagation regime. We obtain the dynamic phase diagram
and indicate those domains where self-oscillating regimes of the crack motion take place.

Unstable growth of cracks in the form of a stick-slip
motion has long been observed in many materials includ-
ing glasses, ceramics, and brittle polymers [1]. In linear
elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) this type of motion was
attributed to a decrease in the resistance of solids to the
crack growth manifested as a negative derivative of the
velocity-dependent fracture energy dÀðvÞ=dv <0. It is
generally accepted that this is related to some nonlinear
processes localized in the vicinity of the crack tip (referred
to as a ‘‘process zone’’) and essentially depends upon the
zone properties. Various mechanisms have been discussed
as candidates responsible for this phenomenon (such as
molecular relaxation, transition from isothermal to adia-
batic regime, crystallization at the crack tip, and micro-
plasticity, [1,2]) though most of these are on a qualitative
level, while efforts to mathematically treat microplasticity-
based models resulted in the conclusion that they are
intrinsically ill-posed [3].
During the last two decades experimental techniques to
study rapid crack propagation have been greatly improved
and applied to a number of materials [4,5]. The similarity
of dynamic fracture behavior of materials with different
microstructures such as brittle polymers, glasses, and some
crystals gave rise to a hope that all of them may be
described by a universal approach. It motivated devising
several phase-ﬁeld models [6] capable of reproducing mi-
crobranching and oscillatory instabilities of straight cracks,
as those reported in [5].
Recently it was assumed [7] that the characteristic
length scale associated with the distance on which crack
proﬁle deviates from LEFMis much larger than the scales
due to any dissipative mechanisms. The results of the
weakly nonlinear model turned out to be in quantitative
agreement with data obtained in brittle gels [8].
One can attribute the nonlinearity accounted for in the
paper [8] to acoustic phonons. In solids with nonprimitive
lattice cells nonlinearity of nonacoustic degrees of freedom
(e.g., related to optical phonons) may take place. If this
happens, it becomes responsible for deviating from pre-
dictions of LEFM. This can result in phase transitions
(PTs) localized in the vicinity of the crack tip referred to
here as ‘‘local phase transitions’’ (LPTs) providing a natu-
ral emergence of the characteristic scale.
The LPT phenomenon attracted attention since late
1970s, being a key mechanism responsible for the effect
of the LPT-related improvement of strength observed in
ZrO
2
-based ceramics and in some steels [9]. Observations
of LPTs at tips of cracks have also been reported for some
other inorganic solids: it has been observed during fracture
of metals (cf. Figure 1 of Ref. [10]) and in ferroelectrics
[11]. Besides LPTwas observed in resins [12] and recently
LPTs following fracture of polymers have been reported
[13]. The LPT effect on the dynamics of cracks has not
been addressed so far.
In this Letter for the ﬁrst time we describe a phys-
ical mechanism responsible for the nonmonotonicity of
À ¼ ÀðvÞ related to LPT at the crack tip, and resulting in
self-oscillations during its propagation. We show that LPT
gives rise to a conﬁgurational viscous friction force resist-
ing the crack motion. It exhibits a descending behavior

In order to describe LPT one can introduce the order
parameter ﬁeld  where value  ¼ 0 corresponds to the
bulk phase away from the crack tip, while the distribution
ðr; tÞ Þ 0, ð1; tÞ ¼ 0 accounts for a new state localized
at the crack tip. This ﬁeld can be described within the
Landau theory of PTs [14] and obeys the generalized
Ginzburg-Landau-Khalatnikov equation [15]:

in this interval the stick-slip instability takes place. Such a
behavior holds also in the ﬁrst order LPT case.
We demonstrate this within the example of a wedge-
loaded crack (inset of Fig. 1) ﬁrst analyzed in [18].
Wedging is a special case of the double cantilever beam
(DCB) conﬁguration studied later in [19,20]. It has been
shown that the DCB conﬁguration possesses inertia, and
the corresponding equation of the crack tip motion has the
second time derivative [18–20]. Using original notations of

Assume the velocity composed of the constant wedge

Equation (12) and (13) is one dimensional, and its
analysis reduces to the enumeration of its ﬁxed points:
the one at  ¼ 0 is interpreted as a focus in (z, z
0
) plane,
while those at  Þ 0 as cycles [21]. This enables one to
attribute various regimes of the crack growth to domains of
the phase diagram on the plane (, V). One of the phase
diagrams for this system is shown in Fig. 2, while the
whole set of diagrams will be given in detail in the forth-

Deﬁning a complete set of brittle materials where the

we make estimates of parameters of our approach within
several examples of crystals exhibiting bulk structural PTs
to which the LPT description certainly applies. Structural
PTs are divided into the order-disorder and displacive
classes. For the order-disorder class of PTs the kinetic

disorder transitions the characteristic velocity may be
small and only slow cracks may exhibit the stick-slip
behavior. In contrast, the LPT-driven instability takes place
for fast cracks for solids exhibiting PTs of the displacive
type.
In the case of the order-disorder PTs one ﬁnds the zone
size (6) R $0:1 to 1 nm. The same estimate for the dis-
placive PTs yields R $1 to 10 nm.

This implies that formation of the LPT practically always
follows fracture in such materials. Indeed, the observation
of LPT following fracture in PbðTi
x
; Zi
1Àx
ÞO
3
has been
reported [11]. This seems to contradict to the rarity of the
reported cases of the LPTs observations. The reason is that
(i) the LPT can only be explicitly observed at the tip of a
loaded crack and disappears with its unloading and (ii) the
zone size, R, is beyond the optical limit. This caused
the LPT being only noticed, if the long-living metastable
trace (forming behind the propagating LPT) was detected
on the fracture surfaces as in the cases of ZrO
2
[9] and
PbðTi
x
; Zi

[11]. For most PTs, however, either the
metastable trace has a short lifetime and decays before the
observation, or it does not form at all.
The dimensionless ratio r ¼ ðEf

deter-
mines the relative contribution of the LPT to the dynamic
fracture resistance. To estimate r we use the expression (9)

The ratio s

and r $1 for BaTiO

. The high
values of r indicate that the effect is important and should
manifest itself in a considerable part of the phase diagram.
To summarize, in solids with nonprimitive crystal cell
stress-induced local phase transitions may take place at the
crack tip. Their crucial role in the crack dynamics is due to
their contributions to the velocity-dependent resistance to
fracture. We explicitly calculated the viscous friction force
due to the local phase transition and showed that it provides
self-oscillating behavior of the crack tip motion within
certain domains of the dynamic phase diagram.

portraits with cycles (b) and (c) describe various self-oscillating
regimes.
